An extensive, poorly-defined area of T2 hyperintensity with

CLINICAL INDICATION: 7 year old female with history of right sided
temporoparietal scalp rhabdomyosarcoma.  Prior MRI had signal
abnormality in the right scalp and along the neck, concerning for

FINDINGS:
 
NECK MRI:
 
There is mild signal abnormality in the soft tissues of the right
neck, extending to the supraclavicular region. There is also

1.  Suboptimal study due to the presence of an endotracheal tube,
which distorts anatomy in the oropharynx in the region of the
tumor resection. If clinically feasible, consider future studies
with conscious sedation, but without intubation if clinically
possible.
2.  Patchy bilateral T2 hyperintensity in the palatal mucosa,
right more than left, with associated patchy mucosal enhancement.
This could represent treatment-related changes given the history
of radiotherapy. Please correlate clinically with direct
inspection.

obstruction. Although a partial small bowel obstruction is
possible, this is considered less likely.

represent adjacent subsegmental atelectasis, a solid moiety of

dedicated CT of the chest with contrast. Alternatively, given
these findings, tissue sampling is recommended, and this lesion
may be amenable to percutaneous CT-guided biopsy.

which is quite prominent.  Comparison with prior exam is limited
secondary to fact that the inferior inguinal region was not being

the left ureter resulting in moderate hydronephrosis.  Encasement
of the iliac vessels with narrowing and distal reconstitution of
the iliac vein, iliac artery appears patent.

In the interval since the prior study, the previously identified left
anterior ethmoid mass is markedly diminished in size with resolution
of compression upon the globe and left orbit as well as no
visualization of dural enhancement on the current examination.
Hemorrhage within the lesion has occurred since the prior study. These
findings are consistent with chemotherapy response to known diagnosis
of a rhabdomyosarcoma.

IMPRESSION:
 
1.  No definite or significant interval change in the size of the
abnormal soft tissue density within the anterior left ethmoid air
cells, consistent with residual tumor and/or residual changes at site
of tumor.  There is new ethmoidal mucosal sinus disease, which makes
differentiating residual tumor from surrounding sinus disease
difficult.  No frank intracranial extension is identified, though
there appears to be unchanged slight intraorbital extension. Further
follow-up suggested.
 
2.  New ethmoidal and maxillary sinus disease, with interval
development of air-fluid level within the left maxillary sinus,
suggesting acute sinusitis.

1.  No abnormal mass is seen in the ethmoidal region on the left side
to suggest tumor.  Linear and peripheral enhancement is seen at the
tumor bed that is similar to the earlier examination.
 
2.  Progressive disease of the left maxillary sinus.
 
3.  Left frontal sinus and left ethmoid air cell opacification that
demonstrates partial resolution.  Mucosal changes within the sphenoid
sinus remain unchanged.
 
4.  Cystic structure that is similar to the earlier examination is
seen with associated displacement of left nasolacrimal duct
posteriorly.

1.  No radiographic findings to suggest tumor recurrence involving the
left ethmoidal region.  Minimal peripheral enhancement is noted in
this region and is unchanged in appearance compared to prior
examinations.
 
2.  There is interval resolution and clearing of prior opacification
of central portion of the left maxillary sinus disease.
 
3.  There continues to be left posterior frontal sinus and left
ethmoid air cell opacification unchanged from prior examination.
 
4.  There is no change in the cystic structure immediately adjacent to
the left nasolacrimal duct and is believed to be an opacified slightly
prominent ethmoid air cell.

1. No definite sign of recurrence of tumor.
 
2. One of the ethmoid air cells is aerated better. Mucosa in the

When compared with 1/2/02, there is improvement in the paranasal

presently identified.

1. Interval resection of large soft tissue mass within the distal
portions of the hamstring muscles. No evidence of soft tissue
mass recurrence or lymphadenopathy around the knee or inguinal
region. Focal enhancement within the surgical bed and posterior
distal muscle compartment of the femur; likely reflecting
postsurgical/radiation changes.
 
2. Focal region of signal abnormality involving the distal
femoral physis/metaphysis findings are suggestive of premature
closure of the physis along its posteromedial region and
associated metaphysial growth abnormalities in the setting of
radiation therapy. These findings are not consistent with
avascular necrosis. The possibility of stress fracture and also
considered less likely. Findings can be further evaluated with
dedicated MRI of the knee with gradient echo images for
assessment/quantification of physeal bone bridge.

Marked interval improvement. There is no longer a definite mass
within the right superior medial orbit but there is an
ill-defined signal within the tumor bed which may reflect post
treatment changes, however, at this time a combination of small
amount of residual tumor and post treatment changes cannot be
excluded. Attention on follow-up.
