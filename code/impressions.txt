Bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, left more than right. 
Accounting for marked differences in imaging technique, the rhabdomyosarcoma centered in the left temporalis muscle is unchanged in size, however there has been an interval decrease in size of the internal necrotic component. Majority of the intraparotid/periparotid lymph nodes are stable in size and do not meet criteria for definitive pathology. There has been an interval decrease in size of multiple cervical lymph nodes, however there is a prominent left level IIa lymph node which requires close attention on followup imaging as it has not decreased in the way the other regional nodes have changed in size since the prior study. 
The amorphous soft tissue signal abnormality in the left face has increased since January 2014, likely related to the interval radiation therapy.

The left nephrostomy tube is in satisfactory position. 
1. Free fluid, blood products, nodular debris are present in the pelvis following left oophorectomy and mass resection. No areas of abnormal enhancement are identified.A large amount of stool in the distal bowel may limit visualization of small nodules.

Changes in mass signal and enhancement is related to treatment, however differences in technique may also be a factor. The LMA device causes significant distortion of the oropharynx and oral airway, as well as local artifact, distorting and/or compressing the inferior aspect of the mass, particularly on the right. If general anesthesia is needed for future studies, endotracheal intubation is requested to decrease local mass effect and artifact.

Essentially unremarkable MRI of the brain. Essentially unremarkable MRI of the pituitary. Essentially unremarkable MRI of the neck. 
Status post right radical orchiectomy without evidence of recurrent or metastatic malignancy in the pelvis. 
Increased size of right posterior paraspinal mass from prior study. The mass approaches the right neural foramen at C7-T1 and extends into the foramina at T1-T2 and T2-T3. However, there is no extension into the spinal canal or spinal cord compromise. Future follow-up MRI should include coronal STIR and diffusion weighted sequences, for better evaluation of tumor characteristics and degree of foraminal extension. 
1. No significant change in size and enhancement of the ill-defined left pre-maxillary soft tissues contiguous with the nasolabial fold, as detailed. Clinical correlation and continued short-term followup imaging is again recommended. 2. A tiny ovoid, T2 hypointense nonenhancing focus located just superior to left nostril, as described above. This area is of indeterminate clinical significance. Please correlate with clinical examination. 
Abnormal signal and homogeneous enhancement within the left nasolabial fold. Given the history of recent excision, it is difficult to assess for degree of postoperative changes versus underlying residual tumor however the study can serve as a baseline for future comparison. Triangular shaped soft tissue within the visualized left lower neck extending inferiorly, likely representing cervical thymus. Attention on follow-up, with imaging to extend to the upper mediastinum is recommended. No cervical lymphadenopathy. 
Irregular lobulated largely nonenhancing material within the central right maxillary sinus, new since 3/16/2016 but decreased since 6/15/2016. While this material may represent inflammatory change, underlying neoplasm cannot be excluded. Follow-up MR examination with consideration for PET exam is recommended. Consideration for sedation for follow-up MR imaging is also recommended. Mild interval improvement of mucosal thickening throughout the paranasal sinuses, right greater than left, as detailed. 
Large mass within the bladder compatible with patient's known embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. The large intraluminal polypoid portion of this lesion has slightly decreased in size. There is extension along the prostatic urethra and involvement of the bladder wall, however no definite extension into the paravesicular tissues is evident. 
There has been overall continued decrease in the size of the bladder wall thickening and of the lobular mass at the base of the bladder as described above with representative measurements. No new lesion is seen. No metastatic lymphadenopathy. Unremarkable appearance of the kidneys. 
Interval improvement of the previously seen circumferential T2 hyperintense mucosal thickening and material within the right maxillary sinus. Continued mild expansion of the right anterior ethmoid air cell with increased material. Circumferential mucosal thickening in the frontal sinuses, right more so than left, containing increased amount of material in the bilateral anterior ethmoid air cells and the frontal sinuses. The low T2 signal material is surrounded by mucosa without evidence of extension beyond the mucosal thickening, which makes recurrent neoplasm less likely. However, continued follow-up is recommended. Increased mucosal thickening in the left posterior ethmoid air cells and the sphenoid sinuses. 
Stable large right skull base mass extending into the nasopharynx, right sphenoid sinus and ethmoid air cells, and right infratemporal fossa as detailed, corresponding to known rhabdomyosarcoma. 
1. Interval decrease in size of a 6.9 x 3.7 x 6.7 cm partially necrotic left abdominal mass invades the abdominal wall, which measured 11.2 x 7.2 x 14 cm on the previous study. The degree of abdominal wall invasion is markedly decreased from the previous examination, and there is no evidence of neural foraminal invasion. 2. Interval decrease in size of an 8 x 6 mm enhancing, diffusion restricting nodule in the pelvis, corresponding to a mass measuring 5.6 x 2.4 cm on the previous study. 3. Interval resolution of previously seen malignant ascites, right anterior abdominal wall nodules, and nodular thickening of the rectal wall. 
No findings of recurrent or metastatic disease to the abdomen or pelvis. 
1.  Interim development of a 6.1 cm conglomerate left external iliac lymph node mass with encasement of the external iliac artery and vein consistent with metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma until proven otherwise. 2.  Persistent enlargement and signal abnormality of the left sciatic nerve may relate to perineural tumor spread. 3.  Posttreatment changes of the primary tumor, surrounding bone and soft tissue and the known metastasis to the left femur are similar to the prior study. 
Asymmetric thickening and enhancement involving the extraocular muscles, more on the right side, as detailed above. Interval prominence of the enhancement and thickening inferior to the left globe as detailed above. Mild asymmetric enlargement of the left lacrimal gland. These findings could be related to underlying inflammatory process (such as inflammatory orbital pseudotumor). Due to disease multifocality, tumor recurrence felt less likely however its not entirely excluded particularly at the surgical site. Stable other posttreatment changes. 
Slight interval changes in the paranasal sinus mucosal thickening and opacification as detailed. Slight interval change of the signal characteristics of the content of the right sphenoid sinus, suggesting more simple fluid content. The presence of inflammatory paranasal sinus inflammatory disease again limits the assessment for small recurrent tumor. There is no definite evidence of recurrent/residual tumor. No acute intracranial findings or significant interval change. 
Continued interval decrease in size of right aryepiglottic/epiglottic mass, with decreased mass effect on the airway. No pathologic cervical lymph nodes by imaging criteria. Interval removal of the tracheostomy.

1. Stable treatment-related changes in the left face and neck, as detailed. No evidence of locally recurrent neoplasm. 2. Asymmetric prominence of the lymphoid tissues of the tongue base, right greater than left, slightly increased from prior study and probably reactive; however, close attention recommended on follow-up study. 3. No pathologic cervical lymph nodes by imaging criteria. Mildly prominent left level 1A lymph nodes are unchanged. 4. Significantly improved paranasal sinus mucosal disease. Resolved left mastoid air cell opacification. 
Slight interval decrease of the size of the lesion, with similar extent and configuration. This appears likely related to interval contraction of the lesion, with decreased internal cystic/necrotic component. There is however a pronounced interval increase of the solid enhancing component in the lesion.  No new lesion. The left sphenoid mucosal thickening and air-fluid level could be in the setting of recent or ongoing inflammatory process. Interval progression of the extent of the lesion is difficult to exclude at this level. Interval decrease of the T2 hyperintense signal involving the right optic nerve, with interval development of atrophic changes of the right optic nerve and possibly of the right optic chiasma. 
Significant interval decrease in the size of the large right paraspinal mass the previous study. There is marked decrease in the AP and transverse diameters of the previously large bulky lesion. Persistent craniocaudal extension of the residual lesion and/or surrounding signal and enhancement abnormalities towards the neural foramen at C7-T1 and into the foramina at T1-T2 and T2-T3. No extension into the spinal canal. No MRI evidence for leptomeningeal metastases within the thecal sac. 
Continued interval decrease in size of treated rhabdomyosarcoma within the superficial tissues of the left face. Stable treatment-related changes in the left face, as detailed. 
1.  Abnormal signal and enhancement along the left nasolabial fold has decreased since the prior exam. Continued follow-up is recommended. 2.

No cervical lymphadenopathy. 
1. Status post right radical orchiectomy without definite evidence of recurrent or metastatic malignancy in the pelvis. 2. New focus of edema and abnormal enhancement involving the left ischial tuberosity at the origin of the hamstrings tendons. Clinically correlate for avulsion injury. A focus of metastatic disease is considered less likely. 3. Right L5 synovial cyst, unchanged from prior. 
Complete opacification of the frontal sinuses, likely containing inspissated secretions on a background of mucosal inflammatory change, unchanged on the left and with increased inspissated secretions on the right which extend into the anterior right ethmoid air cells. Additional mild inflammatory changes in the paranasal sinuses, as detailed. No definite evidence of recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma. 
1. Redemonstration of the large midline abdominal mass causing significant mass effect on adjacent structures, as detailed. The mass is unchanged in size compared to prior exams. In addition, the imaging characteristics of the mass are also unchanged with areas of cystic or necrotic change with additional scattered areas of nodular soft tissue enhancement. 2. The mass effect on the surrounding organs is similar to the prior exam. Again seen is dilatation of the left renal pelvocaliectasis and proximal to mid ureterectasis due to compression of the mid to distal left ureter secondary by the mass. 3. Of note, there is compression of the infrarenal abdominal aorta. The infrarenal inferior vena cava is completely compressed. There is also compression of the renal veins likely also the right renal artery. The other major vessels of the upper abdomen (celiac artery, superior mesenteric artery, portal vein, and superior mesenteric vein) appear patent. 4. No discrete perfusion abnormalities or infarctions are identified in the abdominal organs. 5. Extensive collateral vessels are seen in the anterior abdominal wall as well as in the upper abdomen. 6. No new metastatic lesions are identified. 
1. The patient is status post significant debulking of known left orbital rhabdomyosarcoma with significantly decreased mass effect on the globe and extraocular muscles and resolution of recently noted proptosis. 2. There is soft tissue within the anteromedial, superior, and lateral orbit, which is more heterogeneous and enhances less when compared to the original tumor. Additional 1 cm locule superolateral to the orbit which demonstrates similar signal characteristics and enhancement to the original tumor. These findings suggest the soft tissue to be a combination of treatment related changes and residual tumor. Continued follow-up recommended. 3. Paranasal sinus disease, as above. 
No evidence of recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma. Stable Chiari I deformity, with stable resultant crowding at the foramen magnum. 
Interval partial debulking of the inferior part of the large heterogeneous enhancing lesion, centered in the sinonasal cavities, eccentric to the left, with bony involvement and intracranial extension. Findings are most in keeping with malignant neoplasm. Diagnostic considerations again include a sarcoma such as rhabdomyosarcoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, with esthesioneuroblastoma, Ewing sarcoma or sinonasal carcinoma remaining as other differentials. Persistent intraorbital involvement with compression of the optic nerves, more pronounced on the left at the left orbit apex. Asymmetrical thickening if the cisternal portion of the left trigeminal nerve, suspicious for perineural spread of tumor. This finding is more easily seen on the current study. 
1.  Again seen is the lobulated enhancing mass centered within the vagina. The mass that is located internal to the body is decreased in size. However, the mass component that is located outside of the body is decreased in size. Of note, distention of the vagina is decreased and the previously seen separate vaginal anterior wall nodule cannot be evaluated on CT exam given the fact it would be compressed against the main mass on today's exam. 2.  Multiple enhancing splenic lesions are seen in an enlarged spleen concerning for metastatic disease as it is hot on PET. 3.  Two soft tissue enhancing lesions are seen in the subcutaneous soft tissue of the right leg concerning for metastatic disease also PET avid. 
No findings of recurrent or metastatic disease to the abdomen or pelvis. 
Continued decrease in size of the right paraspinal mass, now minimal and likely containing scar tissue. Extension to multiple upper thoracic neural foramina and between the ribs is no longer clearly appreciated and may have resolved.

No pathologic cervical lymph nodes by imaging criteria. Interval increase in soft tissue in the inferior left paratracheal region and superior mediastinum, most consistent with thymic hypertrophy in the postchemotherapy setting. See dedicated chest CT for complete details regarding intrathoracic findings. 
1. Large abdominal mass with interval change of characteristic. There is interval development of intratumoral hemorrhage and necrosis. There is increasing cystic component and decreasing septation and restricted diffusion in the mass, suggestive of tumor response to the chemotherapy. The mass itself is otherwise grossly stable in size. 2. Improving mass effect to the abdominal and pelvic organs and vasculature as described above. There is persistent mild left hydronephrosis and proximal to mid hydroureter. 3. Patchy perfusion of liver, so-called "nutmeg" pattern, which can be seen in hepatic venous congestion, e.g. veno-occlusive disease. Clinical correlation is recommended. 4. Persistent extensive collateral vessels in the abdominal wall, paraspinal and intracanal regions. 5. Atelectasis in the bilateral bases. 6. No new metastatic lesions are identified.

Stable prominence of left level 1A lymph nodes. Asymmetric prominence of lymphoid tissue at the right side of the tongue base, slightly increased from prior study and likely reflecting a combination of treatment-related volume loss on the left and reactive right-sided changes given the mild increase in adenoidal prominence. 
1. Status post debulking of vaginal rhabdomyosarcoma. The external portion of the tumor has been resected. The internal portion of the tumor appears unchanged compared to the prior exam. 2. The previously seen enhancing T2 hyperintense lesions in the spleen have resolved. 3. Decrease in size of the proximal right anterior leg subcutaneous enhancing nodule with postbiopsy changes. The other more inferiorly located subcutaneous enhancing lesion in the right leg is not within the imaging plane. 4. The tumor causes mild mass effect on the inferior aspect of the bladder and proximal ureter. The bladder is markedly distended. Recommend correlation for symptoms of bladder outlet obstruction. 
No significant interval change in the size, signal characteristics and enhancement of the ill-defined left pre-maxillary soft tissues contiguous with the nasolabial fold, as detailed. A tiny ovoid, T2 hypointense nonenhancing focus located just superior to left nostril is again seen and also appear unchanged. This area remains of indeterminate clinical significance. Clinical correlation and continued short-term followup imaging is again recommended. Interval enlargement of multiple cervical lymph nodes on the right, the largest in area IIA. This could represent inflammatory/reactive changes, but clinical correlation is recommended, with consideration of shorter imaging follow-up, correlation to PET-CT and/or correlation to biopsy as clinically indicated. 
1. Marked interval decrease of conglomerate left external iliac lymph node mass with minimal residual soft tissue abnormal enhancement with less than 180 degree encasement of the subjacent external iliac artery and vein. 2.

Hyperperistalsis of the bowels with collapse of the small bowel loops. No evidence for obstruction. 
Patient status post significant debulking and treatment of known left orbital rhabdomyosarcoma since July 11, 2016, and status post chemotherapy and proton therapy. There is persistent enhancing soft tissue within the anteromedial, superior, and lateral orbit, which is thinner/decreased since the prior study. There has been interval decrease of the locule/focal enhancing lesion superolateral to the left orbit which demonstrated similar signal characteristics and enhancement to the original tumor on the prior study. Interval increased diffuse thickening and enhancement in the left periorbital soft tissues, without a focal mass or fluid collection. Findings likely represent either posttreatment/postradiation changes or cellulitis. Correlation for possible clinical signs of infection. New T2 hyperintense signal and enhancement in the inferomedial aspect of the right orbit. It is not masslike. This finding remains nonspecific, but could represent underlying inflammatory or vascular etiologies; it is unlikely to represent a second neoplasm. There is no obvious evidence of communication with the adjacent paranasal sinuses at least on MRI. Correlate if there are right orbital symptoms. Close attention on short-term follow-up is recommended. Interval improvement of the right paranasal sinus disease. Interval increased opacification of the left maxillary sinus.

1. Post treatment changes as described. 2. Patient appears post extraction of all four wisdom teeth. Abnormal signal and enhancing soft tissues deep to the right masseter muscle adjacent to the right mandible and wisdom tooth socket, favored to reflect inflammatory or infectious change from the recent wisdom tooth extraction. Correlate clinically if there are signs/symptoms of infection. Recurrent neoplasm in this area, while cannot be excluded just by imaging features alone, is felt to be less likely given the recent tooth extraction history and the fact that the original mass did not involve this area. 
No interval changes noted. Stable treated rhabdomyosarcoma within the subcutaneous tissues of the left face, overlying the left masseter muscle. Continued follow-up recommended. Stable treatment-related changes in the left face. 
1.  No evidence of residual intrauterine mass. Myometrium and endometrial cavity are normal in appearance. 2.  Mildly enlarged right abdominal mesenteric lymph nodes were not avid on PET, and are therefore likely reactive. Please see PET/MR report for additional findings. 
Mild residual architectural distortion of the left vaginal wall which appears to involve the mucosal and submucosal layers of the vagina though fine distinction is difficult. No dominant mass is identified, and this may represent sequela of treatment. The appearance is not significantly changed from that noted on PET MRI of February 07, 2017. Clinical correlation is recommended.

In comparison with the most recent study from 2/10/2017, there has been no significant interval change in the residual enhancing soft tissue within the anteromedial, superior, and lateral orbit. There is a stable locule/focal enhancing lesion superolateral to the left orbit, which again demonstrates similar signal characteristics and enhancement to the original tumor. Persistent diffuse thickening and enhancement in the left periorbital soft tissues, without a focal mass or fluid collection. Findings could represent either posttreatment/postradiation changes; their persistence/stability since prior study is not supportive of cellulitis. Interval decrease of the previously suspected T2 hyperintense signal and enhancement in the inferomedial aspect of the right orbit. This finding appears most likely artifactual in nature given its proximity with the air containing maxillary sinus. Close attention on next follow-up imaging is however suggested.

Interval enlargement of right posterior thigh mass lesions with extension through the sciatic notch, extensive intrapelvic lymphadenopathy which extends anteriorly through the obturator foramen and encases the external iliac artery and vein. Concern for thrombus in the right external iliac vein. Doppler ultrasound right external iliac vein recommended. Extensive right internal and external and common iliac necrotic lymphadenopathy. 
Complete opacification of the right mastoid air cells and middle ear with bilateral paranasal sinus disease as described. These findings represent recent paranasal sinus and mastoid inflammation precluding optimal evaluation for tumor recurrence. 
No MRI evidence of recurrent neoplasm in the hard or soft palate. No new lesions identified. No pathologic upper cervical lymph nodes by imaging criteria. Increased T2 hyperintense signal in the sublingual region, and salivary glands consistent with dilated ducts versus vessels, reflecting treatment related changes.

1. No definite evidence of increase in size of the residual enhancing lesion at the right aryepiglottic fold, although on some series it did appear slightly more conspicuous/fuller in appearance, and this may be due to different volume averaging, given the difference in MRI technique. The present study utilized 3 mm thick slices while on the prior study the slices were 4 mm thick.  Attention on follow-up imaging and recommend utilization of 3 mm slice thickness for better comparison. 2. Evolving right anterior C3 vertebral body lesion,  favoring post treatment related change.. 
2.9 cm cystic solid structure in the right adnexa containing multiple cystic structures, which demonstrate low signal and peripheral rim enhancement, which is non-specific, may represent a right ovary with follicles/hemorrhagic cyst, in light of the interval decrease in size compared to the prior ultrasound where it measured up to 4.6 cm. However, if oophorectomy was performed during the radial hysterectomy, this finding is concerning for disease recurrence.  Left ovary is not visualized. Recommend correlation with surgical operative report. If clinically indicated, serial ultrasound follow-up can be performed to document interval resolution with time.

There is an area of nonenhancing T1 hypointensity within the right mastoid air cells which is unchanged from prior and which appears grossly unchanged from the pretreatment images. This is nonspecific and incompletely evaluated in the setting of continued inflammatory changes; residual/recurrent tumor cannot be excluded. Recommend continued attention on follow-up. 3. Progressive bilateral cervical chain lymphadenopathy, favored to be reactive. 
1.  Suboptimal study due to the presence of an endotracheal tube, which distorts anatomy in the oropharynx in the region of the tumor resection. If clinically feasible, consider future studies with conscious sedation, but without intubation if clinically possible. 2.  Patchy bilateral T2 hyperintensity in the palatal mucosa, right more than left, with associated patchy mucosal enhancement. This could represent treatment-related changes given the history of radiotherapy. Please correlate clinically with direct inspection. 3.  Posttreatment changes in the right oropharynx, as detailed. 4.  Marked interval worsening of paranasal sinus mucosal thickening and left middle ear/mastoid opacification.

No evidence of recurrent neoplasm in the left orbit. Stable small hemangioma/venous malformation in the right frontal scalp. Stable nonspecific enhancing benign-appearing subcentimeter lesion in the left sphenoid triangle. 
Status post hysterectomy with no evidence of residual or recurrent tumor. An enhancing tubular structure in the right adnexa is may represent involution or rupture the previously seen right ovarian cystic structure. Alternatively, this could represent a distended Fallopian tube, with internal signal representing small amount of blood products. 
No evidence of recurrent tumor in the oropharyngeal soft tissues, although the presence of an endotracheal tube limits the exam somewhat. 
No significant change in postsurgical changes involving the left premaxillary soft tissues, extending into the left nasolabial fold. No new nodular enhancement to suggest recurrent neoplasm. 
Marked interval improvement. There is no longer a definite mass within the right superior medial orbit but there is an ill-defined signal within the tumor bed which may reflect post treatment changes, however, at this time a combination of small amount of residual tumor and post treatment changes cannot be excluded.
